%1 develop the transfer function by using tf func. in matlab
%2 2nd order as per as choice
%3 3rd order as per as choice
%4 4th order as per as choice
%5 5th order as per as choice
%6 6th order as per as choice
%7 12th order as per as choice

%8 represent the transfer function with 6-12 order two transfer function and
% plot poles and zeroes.
%9 considering a system with -1 and -2 zeroes and +10 and +15 poles
% determine the transfer func mathematically represent it in matlab through
% tf function justify plot and zero using command pzplot.
